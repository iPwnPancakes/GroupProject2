<h2>Travel Expenses</h2>
<p>
The travel expenses folder is where Programming Challenge 6-24 is hosted. 
- The src folder is where each person's submitted code is.
The only person who doesn't have their own folder is Daniel Buenrrostro, who wrote the main.cpp file and the stubs/drivers 
for each Programming Challenge.
- The test folder is where the stubs and drivers are located. These files are to be used in place of each person's code until their final work is submitted.
